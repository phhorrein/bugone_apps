# BugOne zMQ bridge

This is a simple Python library to properly manage the BugOne network. It
provides an easy and fast way to setup a brige from the BugOne network to the
computer. It also offers a zMQ publisher with a simple protocol, which means
that any program which requires data from the BugOne network only needs to
subscribe to the publisher.
